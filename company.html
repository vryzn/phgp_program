Violet is incredibly honored to be playing Leah in this production alongside such a talented cast and crew! Developing and playing this character has been such a joy, and nothing else has given her such a strong feeling of empowerment quite like this! Her previous acting work includes filmed and virtual original works of Lost Boy (Wendy), Rules of Reign (Alicina), and she most recently played Ellen in Vinegar Tom who has a similar vibe to Leah! Violet would like to thank everyone involved in this production for bringing such creativity, community, and cheerfulness into her life (extra special shout out to Chloe, Brooke, and Livy for their dedication to fantastic directing, staging, and organization!) She hopes most of all that you walk away from the show with some new perspectives!

Last spring she directed Henry IV, Part I with Northeastern Shakespeare Society, which ignited a passion for directing. She is so grateful to New Renaissance for giving her a chance to direct once more. She plans to graduate with a B.S. in Behavioral Neuroscience and pursue Genetic Counseling. She is so grateful to Brooke’s sweatshirt (and Brooke) for inspiring the concept for this play and for being an amazing assistant. She would also like to thank the producer, Indu, and stage managers, Livy & Ember, without them this production wouldn’t exist!

You should ask her about the time she turned a boy into a puppet (see Isaac’s bio)! She would like to thank her shopping buddy, Jordan and their car.

Growing up in New Jersey and living in Boston has heightened their senses. They started off as a small fledgling, similar to a baby bird, unsure and unaware of the world. But now they are like a hawk: ready with sharp eyes and a sense of when to strike.

He has spent enough time in the shadows hidden under that alias and is ready to reclaim what he once hid from. He wants you to question as he once did: are you man or a muppet (or rather puppet!)?

You can catch her beauty on Saturdays and Wednesdays from 10:00pm to 2:00am. She would like to shout out Tamara Hadzic in Germany. So if you hear a girl shouting at intermission it’s Nicole. (P.S. Nicole did not submit a bio, so this was written by Chloe Evans.)
