You should ask her about the time she turned a boy into a puppet (see Isaac’s bio)! She would like to thank her shopping buddy, Jordan and their car.

      <p class="card-text">Fran is a first-year Health Science major with minors in Global Health and International Affairs. She’s been involved with all things crew throughout middle and high school, but took a break during her first semester at Northeastern. Missing the community and creativity, Fran is super excited to be a part of New Ren for this semester’s production. She is also super excited about her cut out tomato plant.

        <p class="card-text">I’ve been involved in New Ren since the Fall 2021 performance of Stop Kiss. Then I became New Ren’s Producer and am now the President who also happened to have written this season’s play. When I’m not working multiple jobs to pay off my tuition and rent, I write stories and make films in my spare time and I want to be involved in TV Production/Writing but we’ll see where life takes me!

      <p class="card-text"> I'm a first year Environmental Science and Policy graduate program. This is my fifth semester with New Renaissance, but I have been involved in theatre in some capacity since high school. I'm very passionate about inclusivity in the arts, and I'm excited to continue working with New Ren in grad school. When I'm not in the theatre I can be found looking at bugs at the Northeastern Arboretum.
